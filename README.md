# Molecular-dynamics

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Software Computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms and molecules. It is used in:
* Healthcare/Life Science - Genome Sequencing 
* Healthcare/Life Science - Drug Discovery 

Oracle Marketplace & runbooks
1. [Gromacs on GPU:](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-gromacs) - Runbook to deploy Gromacs on OCI GPUs and run a benchmark. Simulates the movements of atoms in biomolecules under a predefined set of conditions and identify the behavior of these biomolecules when exposed to changes in temperature, pressure and other inputs that mimic the actual conditions encountered in a living organism. Used for establishing patterns in protein folding, protein-ligand binding, and cell membrane transport, making it a very useful application for drug research and discovery.
2. [NAMD Runbook](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-namd) - NAMD  (Nanoscale Molecular dynamics) is a computer software for molecular dynamics simulation
3. [Autodock Vina]() - AutoDock Vina is an open-source program for doing molecular dockingsignificantly improves the average accuracy of the binding mode predictions compared to AutoDock 4, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development
4. [Genome analysis toolkit (GATK)](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/81390072) - A collection of command-line tools for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data with a primary focus on variant discovery The tools can be used individually or chained together into complete workflows. Oracle provides end-to-end workflows, called GATK Best Practices, tailored for specific use cases.

Natural Resources – Agricultural Management 
1. [farmOS]() - application for farm management, logging, and planningIt was developed by a community of farmers, developers, researchers and organizations.There are four main types of records: areas, assets, logs, people.

Visualization
1. [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) - ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application.ParaView users can quickly build visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and quantitative techniques.Data exploration can be done interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView’s batch processing capabilities. ParaView was developed to analyze extremely large datasets using distributed memory computing resources
