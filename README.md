### Oracle Marketplace & runbooks
1. [Gromacs on GPU:](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-gromacs) - Runbook to deploy Gromacs on OCI GPUs and run a benchmark. Simulates the movements of atoms in biomolecules under a predefined set of conditions and identify the behavior of these biomolecules when exposed to changes in temperature, pressure and other inputs that mimic the actual conditions encountered in a living organism. Used for establishing patterns in protein folding, protein-ligand binding, and cell membrane transport, making it a very useful application for drug research and discovery.
2. [NAMD Runbook](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-namd) - NAMD  (Nanoscale Molecular dynamics) is a computer software for molecular dynamics simulation
3. [Autodock Vina]() - AutoDock Vina is an open-source program for doing molecular dockingsignificantly improves the average accuracy of the binding mode predictions compared to AutoDock 4, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development
4. [Genome analysis toolkit (GATK)](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/81390072) - A collection of command-line tools for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data with a primary focus on variant discovery The tools can be used individually or chained together into complete workflows. Oracle provides end-to-end workflows, called GATK Best Practices, tailored for specific use cases.
